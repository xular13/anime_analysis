## **Key Steps & Highlights**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preparation and Cleaning**

- **Handled missing values:** Filled, inferred, or explained missing data in dates, scores, ranks, and genres.
- **Parsed JSON-like fields:** Converted genres, studios, alternative titles, and related anime fields into usable formats for analysis.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Anime Ratings Analysis**

- Most anime have average user scores between **6.0 and 8.0**.
- Very few titles are rated below 5.5 or above 9.0, showing a positive-skewed rating culture.
- ![Anime Rating Distribution](../png/visual_rating_dist.png)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Top & Bottom Rated Anime**

- **Highest rated:** _Sousou no Frieren_, _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_, _Steins;Gate_.
- **Lowest rated:** _Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven_, _Utsu Musume Sayuri_, _Hametsu no Mars_.
- These ratings reflect both popularity and polarization in anime fandom.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Popularity & User Activity**

- Most watched and most rated anime are classics like _Attack on Titan_, _Death Note_, and _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_.
- There is only a moderate correlation between an anime's popularity and its average score, indicating that not all popular anime are highly rated.

- Leading studios (by both quantity and quality) include _Kyoto Animation_, _Madhouse_, and _A-1 Pictures_.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **User Behavior**

- Users are highly genre-diverse:
  - The median user has watched over **60 different genres**.
  - Only a minority of users watch a very narrow set of genres.
- ![User Genre Diversity](../png/visual_user_genres.png)
- Most users give scores between **3.5 and 7.0**; harsh raters and generous raters both exist.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Dropout Rates**

- **No strong correlation** between anime rating and dropout rate: highly rated anime can still have high dropouts (often due to length or pacing).

- Some genres (e.g., _Gourmet_, _Strategy Game_) see higher dropouts, while others (_Avant Garde_, _Award Winning_, _Music_) retain viewers better.
