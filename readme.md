# 🎬 Welcome to MyAnimeList Recommendation & Analysis Project

Hi! 👋  
This is a personal and educational project dedicated to deep-diving into anime data and building a powerful anime recommendation system for my own use.  
As an anime fan and a data enthusiast, I wanted to understand trends in anime over time and challenge myself to create a modern, accurate recommender from scratch.

---

## 🌟 Project Goals

- **Personal Use:** Build an intelligent, flexible anime recommendation system tailored to my own tastes and viewing habits.
- **Educational Journey:** Learn and apply a range of data science and machine learning techniques—covering everything from data scraping and cleaning to advanced neural network models.
- **Trend Analysis:** Explore how anime genres, studios, and viewer behaviors have evolved over the years using real data.

---

## 📂 What’s in This Repository?

- **/data**:  
  Data samples, scraping code, and a detailed guide for collecting and preparing your own datasets.

  > \_Note: Full datasets are not provided due to size and privacy reasons.

- **/EDA**:  
  Exploratory Data Analysis notebook, visualizations, and a quick summary of key insights and genre trends in anime history.

- **/recommendation_system**:  
  All modeling experiments and final solutions—from classic collaborative filtering baselines to neural embedding models with genre awareness.  
  Includes sample model diagrams and output visualizations.

## 🔍 Quick Highlights

- **Cleaned and analyzed** >13,000 anime titles and 2.2 million+ user interactions for EDA and 100 million+ user interaction for training the model.
- **Uncovered trends**: Genre booms, studio impacts, and how fan tastes have changed over decades.
- **Built a modern recommender**: Final model is a hybrid genre-aware neural embedding system, significantly outperforming all traditional methods.
